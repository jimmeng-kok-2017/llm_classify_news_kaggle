# llm_classify_news_kaggle
This project uses AWS SageMaker together with AWS Bedrockâ€™s Claude (LLM) to classify the Kaggle News Dataset into different categories. The results compare the classification accuracy of Claude against the original Kaggle-provided labels. The Kaggle dataset used in this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/text-document-classification-dataset.
